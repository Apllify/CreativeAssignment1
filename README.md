###CREATIVE ASSIGNMENT 1###

This is a small and very compact library which we will use for our very first group creative assignment.


We'll be going with this instead of pygame just because : 
   1. The entire library relies on functions, as opposed to classes used by pygame, which should make it easiser for even unexperienced programmers to just dive into the source code and see how it works / make changes to it.
   2. Since the library's graphical output is very limited, we'll have to put more emphasis on the gameplay, which is the core part of any good game.


For technical information, please refer to the documentation text file.
